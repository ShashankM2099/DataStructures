<p><strong>In the getRootElement, if the root should equal null in a try catch block, trying for a Element not found exception and the else should return the element from the root., and since it’s a T element it should return element of the root.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the first add child, initilalizing the parentNode to findNode method as a parent parameter. If parent and child equal null, im returning nothing. If only parentNode equals null throwing a new Element not found exception, and in the end add child should add parentNode and child.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the second add child, just initializing the childNode as a new multi tree node to child parameter, and the parentnode is adding childNode.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The contains will return null when it doesn’t find the target Node.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN the countDown method, it is a private method, and if the node equals null it should return 0, number of children in node should equal 0 should return 1.&nbsp;</strong></p>
